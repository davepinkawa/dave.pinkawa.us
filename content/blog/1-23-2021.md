Summary: The pandemic continues but one piece of normalcy is back for me, albeit in a new and virtual way. Teaching at William Rainey Harper College!

# Getting Back in the Teaching Groove

So I've been teaching various classes and workshops at Harper College for a handful of years now, and have always enjoyed the opportunity. From the CompTIA A+ course, Intro to Cryptocurrency, Workshop on PowerShell, and a few others that were or still are in the works. These have been very fun classes to run overall, and something I look forward to each semester.

In the Fall 2019 session of classes, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the course schedule like a ton of bricks, and we finished the remainder of that fall class by transitioning to a completely virtual format.

It worked out at the time for our students because a majority of the hands-on work that we do for the CompTIA A+ class (my Fall course at the time) was already passed by the time in-class sessions were stopped. The remainder of the class was conducted over WebEx with me presenting slides, lab work in various virtual machines, and doing my best to give a hands-on feel while being remote.

With no classes at all during 2020, the first year in many that I have not taught _something_ at Harper, I'm excited to say the Spring 2021 class will be running! 

## Planning for Completely Virtual

The hardest part about doing a completely virtual course for the CompTIA A+ class is the lack of hands-on opportunities. While in the classroom we're able to provide a whole list of hardware that students might not normally be exposed to.

Our normal hardware list that is at the classroom's disposal is:

* Lab Server workstation per student for
* 1 desktop PC per student for disassembly
* Several laptops to pass around and disassemble and explore
* Hard drives, SSDs, CDs, DVDs, and many other types of storage devices
* Cables, adapters, and converters galore (Fiber, Coax, Ethernet, VGA, HDMI, etc)
* Network switch, patch panels, access points
* Network and PC hardware tools (Cable strippers, crimpers, punch-down, toner and probes, etc)
* Printers
* Mac lab 
* Peripheral devices (Webcams, keyboard, mice, Bluetooth speakers)

Needless to say, it's going to be difficult for our tactile learners this semester to get a true hands-on experience, but I have a few ideas to bridge the gap.

Thanks to my training coordinator at Harper I was able to gain access to the locked-down building that holds all my classroom hardware and bring it to my home office.

## Bridging Remote and Hands-On Learning

I can't assume everyone that is joining the class will have powerful enough or recent enough hardware to set up a virtual lab, nor will they have access to the many different pieces of hardware the class covers on their own. That's why I'm teaching this right? To give insights and access to these business or enterprise related pieces of hardware.

My goal then is to provide as close to a hands-on view of hardware in a remote learning environment as possible.

Objectives:

    1. Stream video during the class of working inside a PC and with various hardware
    2. Record the video and provide it to students via Blackboard for future reference
    3. Provide access to a virtual lab environment (especially necessary for students without hardware that can run VirtualBox/Parallels/Hyper-V, etc)

For the first point, I plan to use a DSLR camera (also being used for my online photo-class) as a secondary video stream. This Nikon will stand over my desk and stream over WebEx to the students as I take apart hardware, show connector types, and do all of those hands-on things we won't be able to complete this time around.

I've had to do a little bit of hardware shopping myself and picked up a video capture card that will allow my PC to ingest that DSLR HDMI out data. From there, I've output the data to the Open Broadcasting Software Studio (OBS), and created an output stream that can be shared over WebEx and recorded simultaneously. I've done a few test runs, and hope this turns out as a great virtual classroom addition.

## Leveraging Microsoft Azure for Virtual Lab Access

So I'm not particularly keen on opening up my home lab to external traffic inbound. To keep things secure but still cost-effective I've deployed one each of a Windows, Ubuntu, and CentOS server to Microsoft Azure that my students will be allowed to tinker around in, for the duration of the class. 

I do have documentation available to the class on how to setup Virtualbox, but for those students without hardware capable of virtualization, I'm hoping these Azure VMs will again bridge the hardware requirement gap between in-classroom and virtual teaching.

Anyway, it has been fun preparing for the new teaching format and having the time to think about improving it. The rushed transition to a virtual classroom was difficult at the start of the pandemic, but with these changes, I'm hoping my students will find success in their IT career aspirations and studying!
