Summary: Again with no picture taking, but learning about my equipment at a new level.

So as a baseline of understanding, the goal of these two lessons is intertwined and boils down to:
*  What kind of camera do I have?
*  What are the technical specs of this particular model?

I've been working with a Nikon D3300 DSLR camera. Some notable tech specs are the ability to take 1080p videos, a 24 Megapixel capacity, maximum ISO of 12,800, and a 3.0 inch LCD monitor. The imaging sensor is DX-format, which at a max resolution can net me 6,000 x 4,000 which is really nice. 

With my 32Gb SD card it can store 650 of the highest quality images, and stores it both in RAW and JPG formats. I've been playing with Darktable a bit, so the RAW format being available is a nice-to-have for photo editing. 

I really enjoy taking family photos but am hoping to branch out into some nature shots, and this is looking to be a great all-around camera for my use case.

### DSLR as a Fancy Webcam

One new use-case for the DSLR that I've discovered, is as a web-cam. I purchased a cheap USB video capture card for HDMI, and the Nikon D3300 has an 'HDMI Out' port. Using this I'm able to start the video feed from the camera, over HDMI to my PC, and use the DSLR as a direct recording device. There are some odd limits, like 30 minute timeout durations on the Liveview, but that's not a big deal. 

I'm not using this as my daily webcam, I have a Logitech one for all of my regular meetings, etc. But I do teach a CompTIA A+ course at Harper College and am using this DSLR-as-Video to show students hardware up close.

We haven't been able to perform in-classroom computer courses in over a year at this point, and this Spring will be the first course run that is fully remote. To make the lack of hands-on with computer hardware a little more palatable, I'm hoping that my DSLR recordings can give a unique remote-view as we work through the course ware.

Hopefully there will be some photo work soon that I can share, but in any case it has been fun learning about the camera at the hardware level.
