Summary: This assignment wasn't to take pictures of anything in particular, but actually to review the work of professionals. This is my dive into looking at and appreciating other people's work.

So while perusing this insanely long list of photographers on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photographers) and Googling names at random, I came across John Stanmeyer and his work with National Geographic. 

I don't want to spend a ton of time pouring over too many photos, so I've plucked my favorite that I've seen to review.

## Cenote

This is the first photograph I found that really pulled me towards it. Caves are both a running joke for my family (No matter where we travel, we always find a hole in the ground to tour or hike through, _haha_), but also a point of fascination. The way the earth can shape itself in unique ways while having a perceived endless nature due to the extreme darkness, gives me a sense of wonder and exploring every time we visit a cave as a family.

This particular photo is from Mexico, in what is claimed to be an old Mayan cenote (word for underground cave), that is also underwater here.

The cave itself is beautiful with the stalactite formations, but while my favorite part of caves, isn't the focus of the picture. Instead your eye is drawn to the contrast of the blue water against the tan colored walls. The ray of sunshine perfectly hitting the water and illuminating the gorgeous structure surrounding this focal point. 

As I look at it closer the cave itself is nice to look at and the colors are vibrant, the light is shining so bright, and then as your eyes drift left-to-right the dark part of the corner takes a new focus. That sense of wonder, exploration, and maybe a tinge of fear of the unknown adds a whole other element to this photo.

In my own photography I've never really thought of having a focus except for what's in front of me, or telling a story in photo form. But taking the time to review different photographs, and more than just glancing at them, is giving me an appreciation that I hope can translate into better picture taking for myself.

My goal for my next photo-taking session will be to not focus on a single point of interest, but instead take into consideration everything within the frame. I've been watching the snowfall here in Illinois the past week and have my eye on some snow-covered pine trees that could use some photos taken, so braving the cold and taking a few is in order.
