Summary: Photo class First Assignment is to present 2 pictures, your favorite taken photo, and a new one of a window.

I've never really taken an interest in photography before, but while doing some looking into hobbies that aren't completely tech-related, photography presented itself as a fun option! 

I will be uploading Photos to this site in relation to a reddit project on learning photography. The first assignment before the class actually starts, is to present 2 pictures.

1. A picture of a window
2. Your favorite picture taken

The first picture here is of a Window. It's interesting having to align yourself to the window correctly to center things. Hopefully this one came out well, it looked pretty interesting and wintery, and was a fun first endeavor.

This is a picture taken in Michigan of Lake Lac Vieux Desert. I liked the dark framing of the trees and shoreline in front, with the sun still shining on the shoreline across the way.

Of course it wouldn't be a photo blog post without Roary making an appearance :)

We'll see how badly my photo attempts get eviscerated by the class runners, hopefully not too much!
